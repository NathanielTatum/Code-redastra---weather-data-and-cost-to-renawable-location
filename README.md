# 🌎 RedAstra: AI for Optimal Renewable Energy Placement

**Repository:** [RedAstra](https://github.com/NathanielTatum/Code-redastra---weather-data-and-cost-to-renawable-location)  

**Tagline:** Using AI to find the most cost-effective and energy-efficient locations for solar and wind projects.  

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

RedAstra leverages **AI and geospatial analysis** to determine optimal sites for **renewable energy installations**. By analyzing **weather**, **geography**, and **land costs**, our goal is to maximize **energy output** while minimizing **project costs** and **environmental impact**.  

The **AI model** is implemented in **JavaScript**, using data from the **NASA POWER API** to classify, cluster, and predict energy potential across different locations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict renewable energy potential using **NASA POWER API weather data**  
- **Classify** locations into high, medium, or low energy potential  
- **Cluster** similar regions for efficient renewable energy placement  
- **Predict** expected energy output using regression models  
- Rank locations by **energy efficiency** and **cost-effectiveness**  
- Visualize optimal locations on **interactive maps**
