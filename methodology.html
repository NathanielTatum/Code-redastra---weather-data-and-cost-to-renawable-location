        <h2>Step-by-Step Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Using a specified longitude and latitude value, Aneious collects relevant weather info from NASA's climate data API.</li>
            <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> We then combine this raw data with user inputs to prevent temperature or wind speed from causing too much variance outside of the cell’s operational limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Gemini AI Studio Model:</strong> The processed data is then passed to our AI model, which analyzes patterns, interprets energy potential, and communicates results through the chat interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Cesium Ion Interactive Map:</strong> This same data is simultaneously sent to a Cesium Ion interactive map, allowing the user to visually compare AI-selected sites and verify accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>User Conclusion:</strong> Given this data, the user can experiment with variables until they find the most efficient and cost-effective location for renewable development.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>System Architecture</h3>
        <p>We use a chatbot powered by Gemini AI for natural language interaction, a Cesium Ion library for 3D visualization, and NASA’s open data resources for accurate environmental inputs.</p>

        <h3>Techniques Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</strong> The AI gathers weather and environmental data from NASA’s API, cleans and normalizes it, and combines it with user inputs to ensure consistency and reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling:</strong> Gemini AI applies trained regression and neural network models to identify optimal renewable energy placement by correlating environmental variables such as solar radiation, wind speed, and cost efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> The chatbot interprets user queries using tokenization, intent recognition, and contextual analysis, allowing natural interaction and personalized recommendations.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimization and Decision Logic:</strong> The system performs multi-variable optimization to recommend the best renewable energy sites, balancing cost, output potential, and environmental impact through weighted scoring and decision algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Learning and Adaptation:</strong> Aneious continuously refines its models through feedback and new data inputs, improving accuracy and adaptability to changing environmental and cost conditions.</li>
        </ul>
