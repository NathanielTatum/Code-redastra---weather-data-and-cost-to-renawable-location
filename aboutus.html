                <p>We are a team of 4 UH students, who teamed up with our CS skills (and one mech engineer) to create a AI chatbot for renewable energy.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>With our warming planet, climate change is on the top of our minds. We wanted to help in whatever way we could with this pressing global issue. We noticed that the efficiency of renewables is largely determined by the quality of the location that they are placed in. And so, we created an interactive display and AI analysis chat bot to assist builders determine where to build wind and solar power cells. </p>

            <article class="card" id="what-we-do">
                <h2>What we do</h2>
<p>We take large data sets from Gemini, NASA, and compare them to user imputed specs to optimize energy placement of a region. It does this by breaking the data into a longitudinal and latitudinal square and taking the local data for this subsection then finding optimal climate conditions within this area. </p>                <small>Datasets: nasa datasets, gemini default sets, and user inputs.</small>

                <h2>Scalability</h2>
                Given the limited amount of time that the hackathon in which Aneious was born, we didn’t fully complete our goal, although that’s not a bad thing. It means Aneious has excellent growth opportunities, such as adding hydroelectric power by comparing river and rain data and known elevation and population levels to minimize ecological and human damages in dam construction, or A growth in the subsection of data used; which would be possible with more computing power. Finally, comparing local housing availability and zoning laws would allow Aneious to send links to land for sale, which maximizes all known climate variables.</article>

            <!-- History -->
            <article class="card" id="history">
                <h2>Why Aneious?</h2>
                <p>We chose Aneious as a clever combination of the names of relevent greek gods, simply put its a nerd joke. Anemoi is the name for the 4 greek gods of wind, while Helios is the Greek god for the sun, by combining the 2 names we can get Aneious. Which we think matches perfectly considering it is a platform which specializes in assisting with wind turbine and solar panel placement for large scale renewable energy farms.</p>

                <h2>How was it made?</h2>
                <p>During the 2025 red astra hackathon, the 4 of us used our specializations to their best. 2 of us specialized in ai development, while one of us specialized in web development, and finally our team lead specialized in integration of multiple languages.</p>

                <h2>Our feelings</h2>
                <p>
While the irony of using AI in order to push renewable energy sources is absolutely not lost on us, through using it we allow for a increase in energy efficiency. Which inevitably will pay for the energy and water usage which LLM use to run. To which we decided to put a disclaimer on how to pay back to nature, including links to trash cleaning, forrest protecting, and information on one this page
